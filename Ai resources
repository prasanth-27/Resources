AI Agents Are the Hottest Skill of 2025 

But most people are still stuck in demo-land 

This is the roadmap I recommend to get ahead of the curve 

You need to master 3 core pillars: 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Fundamentals: LLMs, prompts, RAG 

2Ô∏è‚É£ Architecture: workflows, memory, tools 

3Ô∏è‚É£ Scaling: deployment, evaluation, reliability 

I‚Äôve mapped 14 courses handpicked courses to guide you through all 3 pillars

1Ô∏è‚É£ Fundamentals

If you don‚Äôt understand the basics, you can‚Äôt build agents that actually work 

üß† This track will teach you: 

‚Ä¢ How to structure unstructured data 

‚Ä¢ How to apply RAG to augment reasoning 

‚Ä¢ How to engineer prompts that don‚Äôt break 

üéì Courses: 

‚Ä¢ Generative AI for Everyone (Andrew Ng) https://lnkd.in/gcY9bpcU

‚Ä¢ http://H2O.ai Large Language Models - Level 1 https://lnkd.in/gcFurVr6

2Ô∏è‚É£ Architecture

Most people treat agents like smarter chatbots. That‚Äôs not enough 

üß† This track will teach you: 

‚Ä¢ How agents plan, act, and adapt 

‚Ä¢ How to wire up memory and external tools 

‚Ä¢ What agent frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen offer 

üéì Courses:

3Ô∏è‚É£ Scaling

It‚Äôs not just about building ‚Äî it‚Äôs about making agent reliable 

üß† This track focuses on: 

‚Ä¢ Multi-agent collaboration 

‚Ä¢ Debugging and evaluation 

‚Ä¢ Production-grade RAG integration 

üéìCourses:
