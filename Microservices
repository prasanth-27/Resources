# Microservice Roadmap

---

## 🧭 Stage 1: **Foundations of Microservices**

### ✅ 1. Monolith vs Microservices

- What is a monolith?
- Problems with monoliths at scale
- Introduction to Microservices
- Key benefits: scalability, fault isolation, independent deployability

### ✅ 2. Microservices Core Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle**
- **Decentralized data management**
- **Service autonomy**
- **API-first design**
- **Smart endpoints, dumb pipes**
- **Culture of automation (CI/CD, testing)**

### ✅ 3. Key Terminologies

- Service Registry & Discovery
- API Gateway
- Circuit Breaker
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication
- Eventual Consistency

---

## ⚙️ Stage 2: **Microservices Design Patterns**

### ✅ 4. Architectural Patterns

- **Database per service**
- **API Gateway**
- **Backend for Frontend (BFF)**
- **Service Mesh**
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
- **Event Sourcing**

### ✅ 5. Communication Styles

- **Synchronous** (REST, gRPC)
- **Asynchronous** (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Event Bus)
- When to use each

---

## 💡 Stage 3: **Hands-On with Microservices (Step-by-Step Projects)**

### ✅ 6. Start with a Simple Project (Java / Spring Boot)

- Build 3 services:
    - Product Service
    - Order Service
    - Payment Service
- Use REST APIs for communication
- Add an API Gateway (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway)

### ✅ 7. Add Core Features One-by-One

- Service Discovery with Eureka
- Load Balancing (Ribbon or Spring Cloud LoadBalancer)
- Centralized Config Server
- Distributed Logging (ELK stack or OpenTelemetry)
- Centralized Tracing (Zipkin, Jaeger)

---

## 🧰 Stage 4: **Data & Transactions in Microservices**

### ✅ 8. Database Design

- Why shared databases are bad in microservices
- How to manage data consistency
- Eventual consistency and Sagas

### ✅ 9. Managing Transactions

- **SAGA Pattern (Orchestration vs Choreography)**
- **Outbox Pattern**
- **Two-phase commit (2PC)** – why it’s avoided

---

## 🔐 Stage 5: **Security in Microservices**

### ✅ 10. Authentication & Authorization

- OAuth2, OpenID Connect
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- API Gateway as security layer
- Role-based access across services

---

## 📈 Stage 6: **Observability & Monitoring**

### ✅ 11. Logging

- Correlation ID strategy
- Structured logging (e.g., with Logback, Logstash)

### ✅ 12. Tracing

- Distributed tracing with Zipkin / Jaeger

### ✅ 13. Metrics & Health

- Actuator in Spring Boot
- Prometheus + Grafana

---

## 🛡️ Stage 7: **Resilience & Fault Tolerance**

### ✅ 14. Key Patterns

- Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j or Hystrix)
- Retry, Timeout, Fallback
- Bulkhead pattern
- Rate Limiting (Bucket4j or Istio)

---

## 🚢 Stage 8: **Deployment Strategies**

### ✅ 15. Containerization

- Dockerize each microservice
- Docker Compose to run multiple services

### ✅ 16. Orchestration

- Kubernetes Basics
- Helm charts
- Service Mesh (Istio or Linkerd)

### ✅ 17. CI/CD

- Jenkins / GitHub Actions / GitLab CI
- Blue-Green Deployments
- Canary Releases

---

## 📦 Stage 9: **Advanced Concepts & Best Practices**

### ✅ 18. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

- Bounded Context
- Aggregates
- Ubiquitous Language

### ✅ 19. API Contracts

- OpenAPI / Swagger
- Consumer-Driven Contracts (Pact)

### ✅ 20. Versioning & Backward Compatibility

- API versioning strategies
- Deprecation handling

---

## 🔍 Stage 10: **Real-World Case Studies & Interview Preparation**

### ✅ 21. Case Studies

- Netflix Microservices Architecture
- Uber & Spotify patterns
- Challenges they solved

### ✅ 22. Interview Focus Areas

- Scenario-based microservice system design
- Trade-offs in communication strategies
- How to scale and secure a large microservice system

---

## 🛠 Tools to Master Along the Way

- **Spring Boot + Spring Cloud**
- **Docker & Kubernetes**
- **Kafka / RabbitMQ**
- **PostgreSQL / MongoDB**
- **Redis**
- **Prometheus + Grafana**
- **Zipkin / Jaeger**
- **Istio / Envoy**
- **Postman / Swagger**
